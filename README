Quickstart for pulling dotfiles onto a new machine:

    % mkdir ~/etc
    % cd ~/etc
    % git clone git://some.where.tld/repos/_bootstrap.git
    % cd _bootstrap
    % ./bootstrap.sh yes_please
    % ./get_repos.sh core editors
    % cd ..
    % make deploy

This assumes, that a recent version of `dewi' is installed on the
system (yes, it must be available via $PATH). Access to a server
carrying the required dotfile repositories is needed as well. If
it is a non-default URI, the environment variable $REPO_ROOT_URI
must be set appropriately.
