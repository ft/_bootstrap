Quickstart for pulling dotfiles onto a new machine:

    % mkdir ~/etc
    % cd ~/etc
    % git clone git://github.com/ft/_bootstrap.git
    % cd _bootstrap
    % ./bootstrap.sh yes_please
    % ./get_repos.pl 0x50.de core editors
    % cd ..
    % make deploy

This assumes, that a recent version of `dewi' is installed on the
system (yes, it must be available via $PATH).


Dewi?

If you don't know what `dewi' is: it's a framework that helps deploying
personal personal configuration files from a central place to the proper
locations in the user's home directory.

Here's a quickstart to get it working (make *sure* you got `txt2tags'
installed on the system - or the documentation will not be generated
properly. Don't bother whining about problems without having dewi's
documentation available.):

    % mkdir ~/src
    % cd ~/src
    % git clone git://github.com/ft/dewi.git
    % cd dewi
    % make sys doc
    % sudo make install
