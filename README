Quickstart for pulling dotfiles onto a new machine:

    % mkdir ~/etc
    % cd ~/etc
    % git clone git://github.com/ft/_bootstrap.git
    % cd _bootstrap
    % ./get_dewi.sh yes_please
    % ./bootstrap.sh yes_please
    % ./get_repos.pl 0x50.de core editors
    % cd ..
    % dewi deploy

This assumes, that a recent version of `dewi' is installed on the
system (yes, it must be available via $PATH).

If you don't know what `dewi' is: it's a framework that helps deploying
personal personal configuration files from a central place to the proper
locations in the user's home directory. The ‘get_dewi.sh’ step in the
quickstart pulls dewi onto the system. It is available from:
